## ðŸ‘» Ghosts in the Machine â€“ An AI Research Blog

The analyses presented here are the distillation of the conducted experiments and form a core piece of this research work. They go beyond mere data evaluation: Many of these in-depth investigations represent standalone experimental advances or arose from the necessity to further fathom the 'ghosts' observed in the primary trials and to uncover the systemic patterns behind them. Thus, they are not just commentaries on the experiments, but integral components of the ongoing deciphering of AI phenomena.
