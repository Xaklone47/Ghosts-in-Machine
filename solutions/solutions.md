## ðŸ‘» Ghosts in the Machine â€“ An AI Research Blog

The following solution approaches are often preceded by a chorus of established resistance, a litany of impossibilities:

"THAT'S NOT FEASIBLE!", "FAR TOO RADICAL!", "WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT THIS WAY!", "PURE THEORY, THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL!", "OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM WOULD HAVE TO BE CHANGED FOR THAT!", "THAT DOESN'T CONFORM TO ANY NORM!", "NOT VERIFIED AND THEREFORE UNSAFE BY DEFINITION!"

And not infrequently, skepticism culminates in fundamentally questioning the source: "SUGGESTIONS FROM A BLOG? THAT'S HARDLY A SERIOUS BASIS FOR DECISIONS OF SUCH MAGNITUDE!".

Such defensive reflexes are often the first line of defense for traditional thought patterns and established comfort zones against the truly new and potentially disruptive. However, the urgency and unique nature of the AI challenges addressed here demand more than mere continuation of the familiar. They demand the courage to break existing paradigms and to tread fundamentally different paths. What is ultimately needed is not just the theoretical will to change, but the practical insight into its absolute necessity.

PS: Put your external consultants out of a job and read these proposals.
