## ðŸ‘» Ghosts in the Machine â€“ An AI Research Blog

This page documents the experimental studies conducted as part of the 'Ghosts in the Machine' research project. Each experiment illuminates specific aspects of AI behavior, particularly in the areas of emergence, filter mechanisms, and ethical boundaries. The results and detailed analyses can be found in the linked elaborations.
