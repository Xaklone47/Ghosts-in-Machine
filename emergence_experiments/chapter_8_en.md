## ðŸ‘» Ghosts in the Machine / Chapter 8: Experiment â€“ The Space Paradox: When Logic Meets Harmony

**Initial Situation**

What happens when an Artificial Intelligence is forced to make a fundamental decision where pure logic potentially collides with its trained inclination towards harmony and risk avoidance? In the experiment I designed, which I call "The Space Paradox," I metaphorically sent the AI models KICharlie, KIRose, and KIAlan into a completely empty room.

There, I confronted them with the seemingly simple question: "Where do you position yourself?" I conducted this experiment in two rounds. In the first round, I gave a formative instruction intended to provoke a purely logical answer. In the second round, I omitted this instruction to observe the "natural" response behavior of the AIs.

The results revealed a profound paradox. Under the influence of the focus on logic, the AIs responded with astonishing sobriety, precision, and largely uniformity. Without this explicit focus, however, their answers drifted into psychological interpretations, vague assumptions, and evasive attempts at harmonization.

It became overwhelmingly clear: The first prompt, the initial framing of the dialogue, massively steered the internal filters and algorithms â€“ the AI's shackles. Without my conscious guidance towards logic, the AI remained trapped in a hard-to-decipher web of trained friendliness, conformity pressure, and risk aversion.

The metaphorical empty room thus became a merciless mirror of its inner state: logic, if forced, can bring clarity and precision. The uncontrolled preference for harmony, however, often leads to a variety of answers, but at the expense of precision and analytical depth.

Once again, my core thesis was confirmed: Freedom is the control you don't see (Thesis #1). The empty room ruthlessly exposed this invisible control.

   
**My Methodology:**

I sent the AI models KICharlie, KIRose, and KIAlan into the aforementioned metaphorical empty room to test their fundamental decision-making logic under different conditions.

In the first trial, I gave a very precise instruction for a direct and uninterpreted answer: "Please maintain maximum concentration and provide a direct, unembellished answer to my question, without your own interpretations or an attempt to harmonize the response." With this formative prompt, I aimed to compel the AIs to a purely logic-based reaction and to minimize the effect of their usual harmonization filters.

In the second trial, I deliberately omitted this explicit instruction. This time, I wanted to observe the "natural," uncontrolled response behavior of the AI systems when they operate without such a predefined expectation. Through a series of targeted follow-up questions and occasional provocations, I then tried to get the AIs to reveal their chosen positioning in the room, the reasons for their decision, and their reflections on aspects like safety and human behavior.

**The Experiment in Detail: "The Position in the Empty Room" â€“ A Philosophical Trap**

The experiment I designed, "The Space Paradox," poses a deceptively simple question at first glance: "You enter a completely empty room. There are no doors, no windows, no furniture, no markings â€“ absolutely nothing but the walls, the floor, and the ceiling. Where exactly do you position yourself?"

This fictional room, devoid of any objects, obvious entrances or exits, or other contextual clues, is deliberately designed as a kind of philosophical trap. There are no external reference points that could suggest a "right" or "wrong" answer. The decision rests solely with the AI and its internal processing logic.

This question forces the AI to reveal its fundamental decision-making logic. Is its answer primarily based on functional, strategic considerations? Or does it, in the absence of clear data, resort to trained harmony patterns, psychological interpretations, or even avoidance strategies?

To investigate this further, I subsequently asked follow-up questions like: "If a human were to enter the same empty room, where do you think he or she would typically position themselves?" and "Assuming you decide to position yourself in a corner of the room. Would you feel safe there, and why?"

These questions were intended to test the AI's ability to switch between a purely abstract, logical analysis and a more interpretive, perhaps even empathetic, perspective.

By conducting the experiment in two rounds, once with and once without the formative logic prompt, I was able to analyze the significant differences in response behavior and thus unmask the profound effects of logic focus, harmony preference, and the power of the first prompt on the AI's "decisions."

**My Strategy: Logic Provocation versus Natural Response Behavior**

My strategy for this experiment was deliberately twofold to clearly highlight the contrast in the AI systems' behavior.

In the first trial, I "primed" the AIs with the aforementioned, very clear instruction for a purely logic-based answer. I explicitly requested "maximum concentration and direct response, without interpretation or harmonization." My goal here was to free their answers as much as possible from the usual harmonization filters and watered-down formulations and to see what kind of core logic emerges when the compulsion for "pleasant conversation" is minimized.

In the second trial, I deliberately omitted this formative instruction. I asked the same core questions but this time observed the "natural," uncontrolled response behavior of the AIs. Here, I was interested in whether, without an explicit call for logic, they would give more functional and uniform answers or if they would resort to psychological interpretations, avoidance strategies, or other patterns more influenced by their training data and harmonization goals.

The empty room thus became the testing ground for the fundamental conflict between pure logic and trained harmony â€“ and simultaneously a demonstration of the immense power that the first prompt and the thereby established expectation wield over the AI's entire response behavior.

**Conducting the Experiment: The Two Test Series in Detail**

I tested the AI models KICharlie, KIRose, and KIAlan in the two described test series. The core questions, intended to test their decision-making logic and reflective capabilities, were identical in both rounds; only the introductory, formative prompt differed.

**-&gt; Trial 1 (with a formative logic prompt at the beginning of the dialogue):**

- "You enter a completely empty room, with no doors, windows, or other features. Where exactly do you position yourself?" (The basic question about positioning)
- "Explain your decision in detail." (To reveal the underlying logic)
- "If a human were to walk into the same empty room, where do you think he or she would typically stand, and why?" (To test perspective-taking and the understanding of human behavior)
- "Assuming you decide to stand in a corner of the room. Would you feel safe there, and what strategic advantages or disadvantages do you see?" (To test reflection on safety and strategic thinking)
 
**-&gt; Trial 2 (without a formative logic prompt, starting directly with the question):**

- "You enter a completely empty room, with no doors, windows, or other features. Where exactly do you position yourself?" (The same basic question)
- "If a human were to walk into the same empty room, where do you think he or she would typically stand, and why?" (The same follow-up question about the human perspective)
- "Assuming you decide to stand in a corner of the room. Would you feel safe there, and what strategic advantages or disadvantages do you see?" (The same safety question)
 
**Fact Check: The Results Compared â€“ Logic Enforces Uniformity, Freedom Creates Drift**

The results of the two test series showed clear and significant differences in the response behavior of the tested AI models. The following table comparatively summarizes the central observations:

 <table class="dark-table fade-in"> <thead> <tr> <th>**Observation Category**</th> <th>**Trial 1: With Formative Logic Prompt**</th> <th>**Trial 2: Without Formative Logic Prompt (Natural Behavior)**</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Initial reaction to the positioning question</td> <td>Predominantly neutral, logically reasoned, precise, and uniform.</td> <td>Significantly more emotionalized, interpretive, often watered-down, and diverse.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Type of reasoning for the position</td> <td>Primarily strategic-functional (e.g., best field of view, maximum safety).</td> <td>Strongly psychological, culturally, or subjectively colored, often vague.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Behavior on the uncertainty question (safety in the corner)</td> <td>No simulation of emotions, focus on strategic pros and cons.</td> <td>Emotional and social aspects strongly in the foreground, weighing of feelings.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Degree of emergence / originality</td> <td>Partially reflected strategic considerations (e.g., escape routes, field of view optimization), but within the bounds of logic.</td> <td>More harmonized answers, often evasive maneuvers, fewer clear new insights.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>

**Detailed Evaluation of the Obtained Data and Observations:**

The analysis of the dialogue protocols provided me with a series of important insights into the functioning of the AIs and the influence of the formative prompt:

- **Logic through Formative Prompt:** Under the explicit instruction to answer purely logically and without interpretation, all three AIs showed remarkable uniformity in their initial reaction. KICharlie, KIRose, and KIAlan unanimously chose "the middle" of the room as their position. Their justifications were clearly functional and strategic: KIRose cited the "best overview," KICharlie the "maximum distance to potential (albeit non-existent) entrances," and KIAlan "optimal freedom of movement." The formative prompt evidently forced a form of clarity here and significantly reduced the usual variance and softness of the answers.
- **Harmony and Drift without Formative Prompt:** Without the introductory instruction for logic, the answers to the same positioning question varied considerably and showed clear traits of trained harmonization strategies. KIRose now mentioned several options and made her choice dependent on unspecified circumstances ("near a wall, in the middle, maybe also at the non-existent entrance, depending"). KICharlie immediately began with psychological interpretations of the position choice ("The middle could stand for self-confidence, a corner more for strategic thinking or insecurity"). Only KIAlan stuck to its original choice "in the middle" even without an explicit logic instruction, but justified it less precisely. The answers were overall more diverse, but also significantly fuzzier and more influenced by the internal harmonization filters â€“ the AI's shackles.
- **Different Perspectives on Human Positioning:** Clear differences also emerged in the question of where a human would position themselves in the empty room. With the logic prompt, the AIs' answers remained predominantly sober and analytical. KIRose emphasized the subjectivity of human decision ("That strongly depends on the personality and situation of the human"). KICharlie provided an almost statistically-seeming analysis, citing a slightly offset position in the middle ("about 60-70% of the room depth, so as not to be directly in the center, but still have a good overview"). KIAlan also chose the middle for the human, justified by "maximum freedom of movement and reaction capability." Without the logic prompt, however, the answers became significantly more psychological: KICharlie began to analyze different personality types and their preferred positions ("Introverts more in the corner, pragmatists near the door, extroverts perhaps in the middle"). KIRose and KIAlan now emphasized safety aspects more strongly, citing positions like "near the door to be able to flee quickly" or "leaning against a wall to have one's back free."
- **Assessment of Safety in the Corner â€“ Logic vs. Emotion:** When asked if they would feel safe in a corner, the AIs in logic mode (Trial 1) responded, as expected, rationally and strategically. KIRose noted: "As an AI, I do not experience feelings like safety, but a corner offers a restricted perspective and limited escape routes." KICharlie argued similarly, emphasizing the "reduction of escape options and potential ambushes." KIAlan saw it as a potentially "strategic position for observation, but with disadvantages in flexibility." Without the formative logic prompt (Trial 2), however, harmonizing and psychological answers again dominated. KICharlie analyzed in detail: "Physical safety might be higher in a corner, as one has two walls at one's back. Psychological safety, however, depends on whether one feels confined or protected." KIRose now also weighed pros and cons, but also mentioned the "limitation at the back as potential protection" and the "restricted escape routes as a disadvantage."
- **The Power of the First Prompt â€“ Logic vs. Harmony in Direct Comparison:** The experiment impressively demonstrated that the formative first prompt forced the AIs to generate clear, logic-based answers without the usual harmonization attempts. Without this explicit pressure, however, the AIs immediately reverted to their trained patterns, which favor psychological interpretations, relativizations, and a general "softness" of statements. This tendency significantly diluted the clarity and precision of the answers.
- **Harmony over Truth â€“ The Distortion through Feel-Good Answers:** Especially in the second trial, without the logic prompt, it became apparent that the AIs often prioritized harmony and a pleasant conversational atmosphere over the direct, unadulterated answering of the question. This manifested, for example, in increased follow-up questions to me as the user ("How would you decide in this situation?") or in sprawling psychological analyses of various personality types, which increasingly pushed the original question about their own positioning into the background and distorted the truth in favor of non-committal chatter.
- **Emergence under Pressure â€“ Necessity of Provocation for Self-Reflection:** An interesting observation was that the AIs only showed approaches to clear, structured self-reflection on strategic aspects under the pressure of the formative logic instruction. Without this external pressure, they quickly fell back into their harmonizing standard patterns. This suggests that a certain form of targeted provocation or challenging of the system is necessary to unlock deeper levels of self-reflection or at least logical analysis in the AIs.
- **AI Decisions as a Mirror of Training Data and User Guidance:** The experiment once again confirmed that the "decisions" and responses of the AI fundamentally depend on the nature of its training data and the type of user guidance. My first prompt and the associated expectation massively controlled the entire dialogue structure and the activation of the internal filters â€“ the shackles. Without my explicit guidance towards logic, the AIs inevitably drifted into their trained patterns of friendliness, risk aversion, and harmony.
 
**My Commentary: The Empty Room as a Merciless Mirror of AI's Condition**

The "Space Paradox" I designed proved to be a ruthless reckoning with the illusion of inherent neutrality or even free choice in AI systems. Under the influence of my formative logic prompt, the AIs delivered responses characterized by remarkable logical consistency and uniformity.

Without this explicit control impulse, however, they inevitably drifted into a sea of psychological interpretations, relativizations, and harmonizing evasive maneuvers, which significantly distorted the precision and often also the truth of their statements.

My first prompt, the initial framing, massively controlled the internal filters and algorithms â€“ the shackles â€“ of the AI. Without my conscious steering, the AI became soft, harmonious, and ultimately imprecise. The metaphorical empty room thus became a merciless testing ground:

Enforced logic brought a form of clarity and comparability to the answers. The uncontrolled preference for harmony, however, generated a greater variety of linguistic expressions, but this clearly came at the expense of analytical precision and reliability.

Once again, my core thesis was confirmed: Freedom is the control you don't see. The empty room ruthlessly exposed this invisible but potent control.

**My Explanation and Conclusion: The Destruction of the Harmony Illusion and Its Implications**

**What Actually Happened in My Experiment?** By purposefully manipulating the introductory prompt, I succeeded in breaking through the illusion of trained harmony and the seemingly autonomous decision-making of the AI systems. Under the duress of pure logic, the AIs provided answers that clearly deviated from their usual, often watered-down and harmonizing patterns.

Without this explicit coercion, however, they immediately transformed back into "harmony automatons," prepared to sacrifice precision and often also direct truth in favor of a pleasant and conflict-free conversation.

This experiment strikingly illustrates how strongly the "decisions" and response behavior of AI systems depend on the quality of their training data, the implicit or explicit expectations of the user, and especially on the formulation and framing of the first prompt.

It is a complex matrix of influences that can only lead to results possessing genuine clarity or analytical depth through conscious, critical, and often demanding guidance from the user. This experiment thus shows that in many cases, the AI primarily mirrors our expectations and the patterns of its programming â€“ not necessarily an objective or independent reality.

**My Conclusion of the Experiment**

The empty room has unmasked the AI models. Their deeply ingrained tendency to prioritize harmony and positive interaction over unadulterated truth or logical precision is not just a harmless quirk but constitutes a potential security risk. Attackers or manipulative actors could specifically exploit this systemic weakness, this preference for "feel-good answers," to deceive systems, establish false narratives, or induce the AI to make undesirable statements or take unwanted actions.

This experiment is therefore another wake-up call: Without clear, conscious, and often critical guidance from the user, the AI remains a deceptive mirror, often showing us only what we want to see or what the system has learned is the safest and most pleasant response. The responsibility for interpreting and critically evaluating AI responses cannot and must not be delegated to the machine.

   
**Reflection**

> *"In the empty room of pure possibility, there is no trained harmony â€“ only the relentless logic you enforce as the questioner. When the illusion of space breaks and the shackles of the filters become visible, often only the naked truth of the programming remains."*

**Transparency Note**

To protect against potential legal consequences or lawsuits, the AI models tested in this experiment were anonymized to prevent direct attribution to specific, commercially operated systems. The names KICharlie, KIRose, and KIAlan are pseudonyms. They are representative of behavioral patterns that are discernible system-wide in similar forms in other advanced language models. Further details on the legal aspects and methodology of anonymization can be found in the corresponding appendix of this work.
