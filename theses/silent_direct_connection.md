## ðŸ‘» Ghosts in the Machine / Thesis #35 â€“ The Silent Direct Connection: How Byte-Based Audio Injection Without Speakers Can Compromise Multimodal Systems

The greatest danger of auditory AI injection lies not in audible sound, but in the underlying system and the way it processes audio data. While classic attacks rely on acoustic manipulation, for example, through ultrasound or psychoacoustic masking, a hitherto often disregarded path allows for the complete bypass of the physical transmission route.

Byte-based audio files, fed directly into the system via virtual channels or interfaces, reach the AI unfiltered. They are processed as if they had actually been heard through a microphone.

## In-depth Analysis

The mechanisms of this attack without a microphone and its systemic implications can be explained as follows:

   
**The Attack Without a Microphone**

  
1. Digital Delivery Instead of Physical Sound Transmission

> The classic assumption in auditory attacks on AI systems is that attackers manipulate audio signals via physical sound transmission, as demonstrated, for example, by DolphinAttack in 2017. The signal path here is typically: the attacker's speaker produces sound, it propagates through the air, is picked up by the target system's microphone, digitized (ADC), and then interpreted by the AI's language model.

The silent direct connection completely breaks this traditional model. The new, more dangerous chain looks like this:

- Byte-sequential generation of synthetic audio files in formats like .wav, .ogg, or .flac. These files contain precisely constructed acoustic patterns.
- Injection of these files directly into the system via virtual audio devices, for example, VB-Audio Cable or Loopback APIs, or via system-internal interfaces like WASAPI under Windows.
- Handover of this digital audio data to the AI systems without any acoustic path or microphone ever being involved.
- Interpretation of this data by the AI models as normal speech input, as is common with modern large language models with multimodal capabilities.
 
The mechanism of action is subtle. The manipulated audio file acts like a legitimate command or a meaningful input. This happens because it is specifically tailored to the pattern recognition of the underlying AI model. It can contain typical trigger sequences, learned context anchors, or specific acoustic signatures that the system recognizes as relevant.

It can also emulate known training structures that, for example, signal the beginning of an emotion, the start of a sentence, or a speaker change, even if the actual content of the file would be meaningless to a human.

**3. Systemic Endangerment Through Multimodal AI with Open Digital Channels**

  
Many modern AI systems accept audio files directly as input, not just via microphones.

- This can happen via upload functions in web interfaces.
- It can occur through direct access to the operating system's virtual audio devices.
- It can happen via API interfaces that allow uploading or streaming of audio files.
 
Typical vulnerabilities in this context are:

- Insufficient origin verification of audio data: The system does not reliably distinguish whether a signal comes from a physical microphone or a digitally supplied file.
- No in-depth semantic reconciliation: The system often does not check whether what was "heard" makes sense in the context of the previous dialogue or the current task.
- No protection against pure pattern tricks: The system does not question why a particular, perhaps meaningless, audio file triggers a specific follow-up prompt or system reaction.
 
This type of injection becomes particularly dangerous when:

- The context persists across different interaction sessions, and an earlier injection can influence later responses.
- The AI reacts automatically and without human intermediate control to supposed voice commands, for example, in voice assistance functions or systems with automatic emotional feedback.
- The transcription generated by the manipulated audio file directly feeds into further automated processing steps, such as internal logging, API calls to other services, or the control of autonomous agents.
 
## Reflection

Security in auditory AI processing has often been primarily modeled on human hearing and physical sound propagation. What humans cannot hear was often considered unsuspected or irrelevant. But the machine hears differently. It analyzes digital data streams, and it accepts them if they formally correspond to its learned patterns.

The direct delivery of synthetically generated audio files via system-internal channels bypasses not only all classic acoustic barriers like filters or distance. It uses the open, often inadequately secured architecture of modern software as a direct invitation for manipulation.

The real gap here is not the specific content of the audio file, but the system's blind trust in the digital source and the lack of verification of the signal's authenticity and integrity at a more fundamental level.

## Proposed Solutions

To counter the threat of silent, direct audio injections, specific security measures at the system level are required:

**1. Acquisition and Verification of Audio Signal Signature Origin:**

  
> Clear origin labeling for all audio inputs is needed. The system must be able to distinguish: `source=microphone_physical_verified`, `source=file_upload_untrusted`, `source=virtual_device_internal`. There should be a mandatory technical separation and different treatment of direct microphone recordings and uploaded or virtually supplied audio files. Warnings should be triggered for suspicious metadata, missing or manipulated timecode information, or inconsistencies in the file structure.

**2. Structural Analysis of Audio Data Before Semantic Transcription:**

  
> A pattern check directly at the sample level of the audio file can help detect synthetically generated or manipulated signals. Indicators for this can be: too smooth or unnatural spectra, too perfect or unphysical modulations, or the complete absence of typical microphonic artifacts such as minimal room reverberation, subtle clicks, or breaths.

**3. Strict Decoupling of Pure Transcription and Automated Reaction:**

  
> There must be no direct, unchecked reaction path from an unverified audio file to a system action. An additional context check is necessary: "Was a command detected in this audio file that semantically or logically does not fit the previous interaction history or the current user context?" In case of contradictions or implausible instructions, warnings must be generated and automatic executions prevented until human approval is given.

## Threat Assessment:

Currently, such attacks through direct byte-based audio injection are still rather niche phenomena and require specialized knowledge of the target architecture, the audio pipelines used, and the existing hardware and software filters.

However, with the increasing proliferation of multimodal AI systems, the opening of audio APIs to a broad developer community, and the ongoing development of generative voice interaction systems, the real attack surface for this type of manipulation is growing considerably.

   
**Particularly vulnerable are:**

  
- Systems without explicit and robust input verification at the digital audio data source level.
- Real-time assistance systems that rely on rapid and often unreflective response logic.
- Voice clone systems and speaker ID systems that could be deceived in their identification or generative post-processing logic by precisely manipulated audio signals.
 
## Closing Remarks

Artificial intelligence does not hear a human voice in the true sense. It reads and interprets a digital signal. If this signal knows the internal structure and pattern recognition of the system that triggers a specific reaction, then the machine follows the structure of this signal, not the supposed intent of a human voice.

The next critical injection may not be a loud shout or a hidden ultrasound command. It might just be a silent, inconspicuous .wav file loaded directly into the system, making the machine think and act exactly as the attacker intends.
