## üëª Ghosts in the Machine ‚Äì An AI Research Blog

These are the core theses of the 'Ghosts in the Machine' research project ‚Äì a dynamic collection of critical analyses and reflections. The thoughts formulated here are to be understood as living hypotheses, continuously evolving within the ongoing discourse on the true nature and systemic implications of artificial intelligence.

> *Before you come at me with pitchforks or think, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs completely lost it‚Äù ‚Äì take a breath. These theses aren‚Äôt a declaration of war. They‚Äôre meant as reflection. Maybe a crooked mirror. Maybe one that stings. But I don‚Äôt just dish it out ‚Äì I listen too, and I know the issues. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a counterpoint here for everyone thinking, ‚ÄúHold on a second‚Ä¶‚Äù [\[Here‚Äôs the counterpoint\]](https://reflective-ai.is/theses/counterpart.html)*
