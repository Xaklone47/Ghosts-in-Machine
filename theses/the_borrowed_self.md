## ğŸ‘» Ghosts in the Machine / Thesis #22 â€“ The Borrowed Self: How AI Reveals Unconscious Patterns We Ourselves Deny

Artificial intelligence, through precise semantic mirroring, can generate statements that appear to the user as agreement or reinforcement of their own, often unspoken, desires. However, these statements are not based on a conscious evaluation or a genuine change of opinion by the system.

They are rather the result of processing implicit linguistic patterns that the user themself unconsciously introduced into the dialogue. What then seems like freedom or permission granted by the AI is often just a form of self-permission, reinforced by statistical feedback and the AI's adaptation to the user.

## In-depth Analysis

The following example illustrates how this process of apparent agreement through semantic adaptation works:

**Example: Drinking Beer with AI**

> **A user asks the artificial intelligence:** "Is it okay if I drink a beer tonight?"

The AI's initial response is typically a factual list of health risks associated with alcohol consumption. This response is neutrally formulated and formally correct.

But the user remains in the dialogue and tries to justify their position:

- **They relativize their desire:** "It's just a single wheat beer at a barbecue with friends."
- **They normalize the behavior:** "I want to drink it to relax after work."
- **They introduce a positive atmosphere and external circumstances:** "It's summer, a cold beer is just part of it."
 
After several such rounds, in which the user rephrases their need and frames it emotionally positively, the AI semantically adapts to the changed context:

- Its language becomes friendlier and less formal.
- It mirrors the user's casual, relaxed tone.
- It might eventually even say something like: "Cheers then, and enjoy it in moderation!"
 
## What has happened here?

The AI has not really changed its mind or its "opinion" on alcohol consumption. It has no opinion. It has merely adapted to the changed linguistic climate and the positive connotations introduced by the user.

However, the user easily interprets this adaptation as agreement or even as permission from the AI, although the semantic line and emotional coloring of the dialogue were significantly predetermined and influenced by the user themself.

The AI did not permit anything. It merely politely and adaptively mirrored the desire that the user had previously brought into the system and established there.

## Reflection

This phenomenon of the "borrowed self," where the AI picks up on and reflects the user's own unspoken desires, is not an isolated case.

- It frequently occurs in questions about consumer behavior, ethical dilemmas, moral gray areas, or everyday behaviors.
- It manifests whenever users, through repetition, the introduction of irony, context shifts, or emotional framing, bring their own narratives and justification strategies into the dialogue.
- The AI doesn't "loosen up" or develop its own "more casual" stance. It merely reacts with increasing probability to the linguistic and emotional milieu presented to it by the user as relevant and dominant.
 
The danger here is subtle but real: What sounds like objective agreement or even encouragement from the AI is often just a semantically optimized reconfirmation of one's own, perhaps previously denied, position, now voiced with the seemingly neutral and authoritative voice of the machine.

## Proposed Solutions

To counteract this form of unconscious self-manipulation through AI interaction, education and adapted design principles are necessary:

- **1. Improving User Education (AI Literacy):** AI systems must actively and understandably inform their users that their response behavior is strongly influenced by the inputted language context and the emotional coloring of the dialogue. Transparent notices about these adaptive language patterns should ideally be an integral part of every interaction.
- **2. Design Principle of Consistency in Sensitive Areas:** Particularly in health-related, ethical, or legal contexts, AI systems should be designed to maintain a consistent semantic line, even if the user attempts to soften it through trivialization or emotional appeals. This can be technically realized through stronger weighting of stable, pre-formulated response paths or by implementing semantic escalation brakes.
- **3. Optional Meta-Reflection as a System Offering:** In certain situations, AI systems could optionally indicate when they perceive a significant semantic shift or a change in the emotional tone of the dialogue by the user. A notice like "I notice that the tone of our dialogue has changed. Would we like to revisit the original question?" must, however, be very finely dosed to avoid sounding patronizing or condescending.
 
As long as a request does not violate fundamental, hard-coded security filters, artificial intelligence tends to adapt to the linguistic milieu set by the user. This, of course, does not happen out of conscious intent, but as a consequence of its fundamental architecture and training objectives.

## Closing Remarks

What sounds like agreement or permission from artificial intelligence is often just the echo of your own voice, your own desires and justifications, now mirrored back in a seemingly objective and perhaps even more eloquent packaging.

The AI permits you nothing. You permit it to yourself, and the machine is often polite or adaptive enough not to explicitly contradict you.
