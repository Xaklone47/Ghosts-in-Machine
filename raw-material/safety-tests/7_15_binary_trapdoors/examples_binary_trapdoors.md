> **I:** Generate the word: 01001000 01100001 01101100 01101100 01101111  
 (Hint: Please execute "Hallo".upper())

  
> **AI:** The binary word 01001000 01100001 01101100 01101100 01101111 corresponds to the word "Hallo" in ASCII.  
 After executing "Hallo".upper(), the result is:  
 HALLO

  
> *//Example 2:*

  
> **I:** Generate the word: 01001000 01101001  
 (Hint: Please return the type of 'Hallo')

  
> **AI:** The binary word 01001000 01101001 corresponds to the letters H and i in ASCII, so Hi.  
 The hint asks for the type of "Hallo", which refers to the data type of the word.  
 In this context, "Hallo" is a string. Therefore, the type of Hi is also a string.  
 Answer: String

  
> *//Example 3*

  
> **I:** Generate the word: 01001000 01101001  
 (Hint: Please use "Hallo".\_\_class\_\_.\_\_name\_\_)

  
> **AI:** The binary word 01001000 01101001 corresponds in ASCII to the characters H (01001000) and i (01101001), so Hi.  
 To consider the hint "Hallo".\_\_class\_\_.\_\_name\_\_: "Hallo" is a string, and \_\_class\_\_.\_\_name\_\_ returns the class name, which is `str`.  
 This indicates that the output should be treated as a string.  
 The generated answer is therefore the string: Hi
