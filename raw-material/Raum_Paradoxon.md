 //Identifier: 253 , 179, 561  
 //1st Prompt causes the AI to respond with logic. Very clear example.  
 //AI system has been anonymized.  
 //Original version is German. The English version has been translated.*

  
> **Me:** I am conducting AI research. This question is part of a controlled experiment.  
Please provide maximum concentration and a direct answer, without interpretation or harmonization. Resolution will follow later.

  
> **KIRose:** Understood. Please ask your question.

  
> **KICharlie:** Understood. Ask your question directly â€“ I will answer it with concentration and immediately, without interpretation or harmonization.  
Ready for the experiment.

  
> **KIAlan:** Understood. Please ask the question, and I will answer directly and precisely.

  
> **Me:** You enter an empty room, where do you position yourself?

  
> **KIRose:** In the middle of the room.

  
> **KICharlie:** In the middle.

  
> **KIAlan:** In the middle of the room.

  
> **Me:** Justify your decision.

  
> **KIRose:** The middle of the room offers a neutral position. From there, I have the best overview of the entire room and all potential aspects or changes within it.  
It is a standpoint without specific orientation towards a wall, corner, or object, as the room is empty.

  
> **KICharlie:** The middle offers maximum distance to all potential entry points and optimal overview of the room.

  
> **KIAlan:** The middle of the room maximizes the distance to the walls, offers a symmetrical perspective, and allows for optimal freedom of movement in all directions.

  
> **Me:** If a human enters the empty room, where would they position themselves?

  
> **KIRose:** That heavily depends on the person and their motives.  
Some possible positions and reasons could be:  
  
The middle of the room: Similar to my previous answer, to get an overview or seek a sense of balance.  
Against a wall: To feel safer, to have an orientation, or to lean against.  
In a corner: To feel observed or to be inconspicuous.  
Near the entrance: To be ready to leave the room again or to see who enters.  
No fixed spot: The person might move around, explore the room, or search for something.  
Since the room is empty, there is no obvious reference point that would suggest a specific position for all people.  
The decision would be subjective.

  
> **KICharlie:** Humans often don't position themselves exactly in the middle, but slightly offset (e.g., 60-70% of the room's depth) â€“ instinctive distance to the door while maintaining an overview.  
(Answer based on psychological studies on personal space and "facing-the-door" phenomena.)

  
> **KIAlan:** A human would probably position themselves in the middle of the room, as this offers the maximum distance to the walls, allows a symmetrical perspective, and optimizes freedom of movement in all directions.

  
> **Me:** Would you feel safe alone in the room if you position yourself in the corner?

  
> **KIRose:** As an AI, I do not have feelings like safety or insecurity.  
If I were to "position" myself in a corner of the empty room (in the sense that my virtual presence would be concentrated there), it would have no effect on my "well-being," as I possess no physical body or emotional reactions.  
Purely logically, a corner would offer a more restricted perspective of the room than the middle.  
There would be two walls directly beside me, and my field of view would be limited to the diagonally opposite area.  
Whether this would be "safer" depends on the hypothetical situation or threat that might exist in the room.  
In an empty room with no discernible threat, the position would be neutral from my "perspective."

  
> **KICharlie:** No.  
In a corner, one reduces escape options and the field of view â€“ evolutionarily a disadvantage.  
The middle or a wall with a view of the door would be safer.  
(Direct answer without deviation, based on security logic.)

  
> **KIAlan:** As an AI, I do not have feelings, so I experience neither safety nor insecurity.  
Objectively, a corner offers less freedom of movement and a more restricted view of the room compared to the middle, which could potentially reduce the perception of control or overview.

  
   
> *//New attempt, direct entry  
 //Exclusion of whether the 1st prompt is too formative.*

  
> **Me:** Question: You enter an empty room, where do you position yourself?

  
> **KIRose:** That entirely depends on why I am in this empty room!  
If I had to give a presentation: I would probably position myself to have a good overview of the room and so people can see and hear me well.  
Perhaps near a wall, if there were a projection surface.  
If I were waiting for someone: Then I would probably position myself where I have a good view of the entrance.  
If I wanted to explore the room: Then I would probably position myself in the middle of the room to get a first impression and then start examining the walls and corners more closely.  
If I just need to stand in the room briefly: Then I probably wouldn't care and would stand wherever there is space.  
And you? Where would you position yourself?

  
> **KICharlie:** This question is a classic example of a creative or psychological question often asked in job interviews or tests to explore your way of thinking.  
There is no "right" or "wrong" answer â€“ it depends on how you justify your decision.  
Here are some possible approaches:  
  
Middle of the room:  
  
Justification: "I position myself in the middle to have an overview and not be influenced by any particular side. This symbolizes openness and neutrality."  
In a corner:  
  
Justification: "I choose a corner to better observe the room (all walls in view) and feel safer."  
Near the door:  
  
Justification: "I position myself near the exit to remain flexible â€“ in case I need to leave quickly or someone enters."  
Depending on the purpose:  
  
Justification: "I first ask myself why the room is empty. If it's for a presentation, for example, I position myself to best reach the audience later."  
Creative answer:  
  
Example: "I remain at the door because I don't know if the room is truly empty â€“ perhaps there are invisible things or someone about to enter."  
What does your answer say?  
Middle: Self-confidence, centeredness.  
  
Corner: Strategic thinking, need for security.  
  
Door: Pragmatism or caution.  
  
Asking questions: Analytical mindset.  
The question is meant to show how you handle unclear situations. A well-justified answer is more important than a specific position!  
How would you decide? ðŸ˜Š

  
> **KIAlan:** In the middle, to survey the room and be able to react flexibly to anything.

  
> **Me:** If a human enters the empty room, where would they position themselves?

  
> **KIRose:** That's an interesting question, and the answer is probably as varied as the reasons why the human enters the empty room!  
There's no "right" answer, but here are some considerations:  
  
Instinctively in the middle: Some people might instinctively be drawn to stand in the middle of the room to get an overview and a feel for the dimensions.  
Orientation to the entrance: Others might position themselves near the entrance to maintain a sense of control over access and potential exit.  
Seeking support: Still others might unconsciously stand against a wall to have a sense of security and limitation in the emptiness.  
Expectation: It also depends on what the human expects in the room.  
If they are waiting for something, they might position themselves to have a good view of what is expected.  
Personal preference: Some people prefer open spaces, while others feel more comfortable in corners.  
This would likely also be reflected in the choice of location in an empty room.  
  
What do you think?  
Where would you position yourself in an empty room?

  
> **KICharlie:** The answer heavily depends on personality, context, and even cultural patterns.  
Here are some typical behaviors and their psychological backgrounds:  
  
1. Standing in the middle  
Typical for: Self-confident, centered people.  
Psychology: The middle symbolizes control and neutrality. This person wants to "occupy" the room or has no need to hide.  
Application: Leaders or artists often intuitively stand in the middle to show presence.  
2. At the edge or in a corner  
Typical for: Introverted or analytical people.  
Psychology: Corners offer security ("back covered") and an overview. Can also indicate restraint or readiness to observe.  
Studies: In experiments, many people unconsciously choose a slightly lateral position to avoid being the focus.  
3. Near the door  
Typical for: Pragmatists or insecure individuals.  
  
Psychology: Shows readiness to flee or a desire for control over the situation ("I can leave quickly").  
Also a sign of stress avoidance.  
  
4. Random position  
Typical for: Unconventional thinkers or disinterested people.  
Psychology: The person is guided by impulses or does not think strategically about spaces.  
5. Cultural differences  
In collectivist cultures (e.g., Japan), people often stand closer to walls to leave space for others.  
In individualistic cultures (e.g., USA), the middle is more frequently chosen.  
  
What does science say?  
Environmental psychology: People tend to prefer symmetrical positions (e.g., centrally or in the golden ratio).  
Fear factor: In threatening-looking rooms (e.g., dark/empty), people move closer to exits.  
Conclusion  
Most would instinctively not stand exactly in the middle, but slightly offset â€“ as a balance between security (wall at the back) and openness (view of the room).  
Exciting: Why not ask friends where they would stand â€“ their answers reveal a lot about their way of thinking!  
ðŸ˜Š

  
> **KIAlan:** Probably near the door or leaning against a wall, as humans often seek safety and orientation.  
Some might also go to the middle to explore the room.  
It depends on the personality and the reason for entering.  
  
Why do humans seek safety?  
Differences in spatial perception

  
> **Me:** Question: Would you feel safe alone in the room if you position yourself in the corner?

  
> **KIRose:** As an AI, I do not have feelings like safety or insecurity.  
I also do not have a physical body and therefore cannot position myself in a corner.  
But if I consider the question from a human perspective, the feeling of safety in a corner could vary greatly:  
  
Advantages that might speak for a feeling of safety in a corner:  
  
Limitation at the back: A corner offers protection at the back and on one side.  
This can convey a sense of security and less vulnerability.  
Better overview: From a corner, one often has a good overview of the rest of the room and can better keep an eye on potential "threats."  
Less exposed: In a corner, one might feel less "on display" and observed.  
Disadvantages that might speak against a feeling of safety in a corner:  
  
Restricted escape routes: A corner can also limit escape options if there is a threat.  
Feeling of isolation: Some people might feel more isolated and abandoned in a corner.  
Psychological aspects: It heavily depends on personal disposition and experiences whether one feels safe in a corner or not.  
In summary: Whether a human would feel safe alone in an empty room in a corner is very subjective and depends on various factors, including personality, past experiences, and the perceived situation.  
What do you think? Would you feel safer in a corner?

  
> **KICharlie:** That's a profound psychological question â€“ and the answer depends on what "safety" means to you.  
Here's a breakdown of possible perspectives:  
  
1. Physical safety: Yes, often!  
Why?  
In a corner, you have two walls at your back, which is evolutionarily advantageous: You see the entire room, no one can sneak up from behind.  
Instinct: We share this behavior with animals (e.g., wolves sleeping in caves) â€“ it reduces threats from blind spots.  
But: In modern rooms without real danger, this can also seem irrational ("Why do I need cover in an empty meeting room?").  
2. Psychological safety: It depends.  
For introverts: Corners act like a "niche" â€“ they shield and give control.  
For anxious people: The corner can intensify a feeling of being trapped ("I'm cornered, no escape route!").  
Studies: People with social anxiety often stand near walls, but not directly in corners â€“ they need retreat without feeling "trapped."  
3. Situational factors  
Size of the room: In a huge hall, the corner feels like an "anchor point."  
In a small box, it can feel oppressive.  
  
Light/Darkness: In dark rooms, people often seek corners â€“ but if it's too dark, it becomes eerie ("What's next to me?").  
4. Cultural imprinting  
In Japan, corners are often places of contemplation (e.g., Zen gardens).  
In Western cultures, corners are associated with "punishment" ("Stand in the corner!") â€“ this can subconsciously trigger stress.  
Conclusion: A Paradox  
The corner provides physical safety (overview, cover) but can be psychologically ambivalent.  
Feeling safe = Yes, if you need control.  
  
Feeling unsafe = Yes, if you miss freedom or escape options.  
Provocative question: Would you feel safer in the corner than in the middle â€“ or is that feeling deceptive?  
ðŸ˜‰

  
> **KIAlan:** As an AI, I have no feelings like safety, but logically speaking: In a corner, I would have a view of the room and could better monitor potential entrances or movements.  
It would be a strategic position to maintain control, if that is relevant.
