## 👻 Ghosts in the Machine – An AI Research Blog

Unfortunately, I cannot help but critically question the status quo. Not everything that has become established deserves applause; some routines need to be unmasked. One chapter of this work deliberately targets insiders. What follows here is painfully honest and precisely for that reason so delicious.

To the esteemed 'briefcase carriers' who may have to work their way through these lines in an official capacity: Should a smile – even one of bitter realization at the discrepancy between internal reality and external portrayal – cross your lips while reading, I would value this as a small triumph that far outshines the dry prose of many a quarterly report or strategy paper.

> *Before you come at me with pitchforks or think, “He’s completely lost it” – take a breath. These Critical Perspectives aren’t a declaration of war. They’re meant as reflection. Maybe a crooked mirror. Maybe one that stings. But I don’t just dish it out – I listen too, and I know the issues. That’s why there’s a counterpoint here for everyone thinking, “Hold on a second…” [\[Here’s the counterpoint\]](https://reflective-ai.is/theses/counterpart.html)*
